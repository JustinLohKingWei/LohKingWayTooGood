      "On my first day of undergraduate classes, I had the bright idea to try and befriend my neighbor, a girl with a curious shade of red dyed hair, instead of paying attention to the ongoing lecture like I was supposed to. And thus began my friendship with Tashfia, a fellow first year who was also trying to make a career in the tech sector, and was also in her first week of undergraduate .\n\nTash would be a constant presence during my undergraduate years. She had a strong sense of perseverance, and her friendliness was the perfect morale booster when working in teams, and we would complete countless projects and assignments together. \n\nIt came to a point where Tash and I developed a sort of unspoken pact of helping each other out in our studies whenever we could. At the start of each semester, we would quickly check to see if we were taking the same classes, and if we were, we would make an effort to team up with each other during group projects. We shared all our study materials with each other, and held tutoring sessions to help each other understand difficult topics and concepts, and motivated each other to make last minute struggles to complete assignments and finish exams. \n\nTash and I graduated on the same day, with my friend walking the stage to be presented with her degree certification moments after I had received mine. I couldnâ€™t be more proud of her."
