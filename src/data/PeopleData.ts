      "One of my oldest friends. Elaine and I have not physically seen each other for the better half of the past decade. Yet,there isn't much of my life that I can recall that Elaine has not been part of.\n\nI will never forget the way we became friends. We got in trouble one day for arguing with a prefect who was being rather pompous with the school rules. I ended up overdoing things and found myself at the disciplinary office later on. I caught an earful that day, yet I also gained a friend.\n\nAcross the years, she has seen me through all sorts of ups and downs as I slogged through adulthood, always presenting herself as the voice of empathy and encouragement, no matter the situation. Even as times slowly passed, and we both slowly grew away from the kids we once were, she still remained the kind, compassionate girl I had first befriended all those years ago; and she still never failed to see good in me, even at times when I couldn’t. \n\nI would end up receiving my iron ring with Elaine’s old watch firmly strapped to my wrist, and I am immensely grateful for her friendship and care across all these years. I move forward in life, blessed to know that I have my friend's support and encouragement in whatever I do, and hope I will one day be able to see my friend again.",

      "I met Haw a month after I had left home, him at the time being a computer science student from McGill. Safe to say,I was delighted, not just because I had another peer to geek out with, but also glad that I had found one of my first friends abroad. Little would I know that Haw would turn into one of my closest friends during my university life. \n\n Funny enough, It always seemed that he always was the one bailing me out of trouble, and laughing it off with me much later, which obviously also leaves him with an impressive stack with some of the most embarrassing stories from my various misadventures. I often wonder if this is how it feels to have an older brother.\n\nIn the moments we worked together, I found Haw to have an innate sense towards detail, while also being very knowledgeable about the tech industry. Yet, he remains one of the most humble people I have met, and would often spend time to teach me new concepts, or point me in the direction of relevant technologies. Even after graduation, Haw has remained a figure of encouragement for my career ahead.\n\nToday, my friend is an established software engineer who always seems to be one step ahead of me in life. Yet, I wouldn't want things to be any other way, and I’m glad to have someone like that to look up to, and remind me about the challenges I must face in our line of work.",

    description:
      "On my first day of undergraduate classes, I had the bright idea of befriending my neighbor, a girl with a curious shade of red dyed hair, instead of paying attention to the ongoing lecture like I was supposed to. And thus began my friendship with Tashfia, a fellow first year who was also trying to make a career in the tech sector, and was also in her first week of undergraduate .\n\nTash would be a constant presence during my undergraduate years. She had a strong sense of perseverance, and her friendliness was the perfect morale booster when working in teams, and we would complete countless projects and assignments together. \n\nIt came to a point where Tash and I developed a sort of unspoken pact of helping each other out in our studies whenever we could. At the start of each semester, we would quickly check to see if we were taking the same classes, and if we were, we would make an effort to team up with each other during group projects. We shared all our study materials with each other, and held tutoring sessions to help each other understand difficult topics and concepts, and motivated each other to make last minute struggles to complete assignments and finish exams. \n\nTash and I graduated on the same day, with my friend walking the stage to be presented with her degree certification moments after I had received mine. I couldn’t be more proud of her.",
