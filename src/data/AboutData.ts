    "\n\nSurprisingly. I was not the fondest of my profession when I enrolled for a software engineering degree. I found myself in constant frustration towards software development at the coding level ; At how rigid different rules and architectures were set up, which made every error seem like a stubborn mule which refused to listen to anybody. I was frequently discouraged at all the complicated technological concepts, which were undoubtedly accompanied by steep learning curves.\n\n Things would eventually worsen to the point where every task seemed insurmountable and there was barely any joy in learning further. It was at this point that I first considered switching professions. \n\nEventually, as I was exposed to working with my peers in team projects. It would be in these environments, where I would find a fondness in participating in mentoring sessions with my friends and teammates. Like a spark in the night, I found my way. The joy of mentoring and learning from others, whilest also growing myself, was the small shred of humanity I was searching for. It was not just about completing the task at hand anymore, but also learning and growing with those around me, to become better with each other's help, and to be proud of one another when sucess comes knocking.\n\nSometimes, I catch myself wondering... Why do I push myself so much? Why is it that I do what I do, with all the frowns and troubles that come in this line of work? \n\n It's because I want to be better, both for myself and those around me. I want to make less mistakes, be more knowledgeable in the work I am presented with, and make things that I can be proud of.This is who I am, who I want to be. \n\n I am Justin Loh.",
