    "\n\nSurprisingly. I was not the fondest of my profession when I enrolled for a software engineering degree. I found myself in constant frustration towards software development at the coding level;  At how rigid different rules and architectures were set up, at complicated concepts which were accompanied by steep learning curves, which made every error become stubbornly difficult to solve.\n\n Things would eventually worsen to the point where every task seemed insurmountable and I found barely any joy in learning further. It was at this point that I felt completely skill-less, and I considered switching professions. \n\nI like to think that things began to change once I was exposed to working with my peers in team projects. It would be in these environments, where I would find a fondness in participating in mentoring sessions with my friends and teammates. Like a spark in the night, I found a new interest and excitement in figuring out how to work with peers of different skill levels, backgrounds, working ethics. The joy of mentoring and learning from others, whilest also growing myself, was the small shred of humanity I was searching for. It was not just about completing the task at hand anymore, but also learning and growing with those around me, to become better with each other's help, and to be proud of one another when sucess eventually comes knocking.\n\nSometimes, I still catch myself wondering... Why do I push myself so much? Why is it that I do what I do, with all the frowns and troubles that come in this line of work? \n\n It's because I want to be better, both for myself and those around me. I want to make less mistakes, be more knowledgeable in the work I am presented with, and make things that I can be proud of. \n\nThis is who I am, who I want to be.",
