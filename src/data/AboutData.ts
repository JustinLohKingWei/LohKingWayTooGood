    "\n\nSurprisingly. I was not the fondest of my profession when I enrolled for a software engineering degree. I was in constant frustration towards software development at the coding level ; at how rigid different rules and architectures were set up,which made every error seem like a stubborn mule which refused to listen to anybody. I was frequently discouraged at how complicated different technological concepts, which were undoubtedly accompanied by steep learning curves.\n\n Things would eventually worsen to the point I doubted my place in this profession. And like a spark in the night, I found the humanity in teaching and learning. The joy of mentoring and learning from others, whilest also growing myself, was the small shred of humanity I was searching for.\n\nSometimes, I catch myself wondering... Why do I push myself so much? Why is it that I do what I do, with all the frowns and troubles that come in this line of work? \n\n It's because I want to be better, both for myself and those around me. I want to make less mistakes, be more knowledgeable in the work I am presented with, and make things that I can be proud of.\n\n This is who I am, who I want to be.",
