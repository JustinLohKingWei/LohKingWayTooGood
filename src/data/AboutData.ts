    "\n\nSometimes, I catch myself wondering... Why do I push myself so much? Why is it that I do what I do, with all the frowns and troubles that come in this line of work? \n\n It's because I want to be better, both for myself and those around me. I want to make less mistakes, be more knowledgeable in the work I am presented with, and make things that I can be proud of. ",
